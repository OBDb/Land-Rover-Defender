generations:
  - name: "Land Rover Ninety and One Ten"
    start_year: 1983
    end_year: 1990
    description: "The coil-sprung Land Rover was introduced in 1983 as the Land Rover One Ten, with the Land Rover Ninety following in 1984. These models marked a significant departure from the Series III Land Rover, featuring coil spring suspension front and rear (replacing leaf springs), permanent four-wheel drive derived from the Range Rover with a two-speed transfer gearbox and lockable centre differential, and a modernized interior. The numbers 90 and 110 referred to their wheelbase lengths in inches, despite the Ninety actually having a 92.9-inch wheelbase. The One Two Seven with a 127-inch wheelbase joined in 1985 for heavier load capacity. Both models featured a separate steel ladder chassis with aluminum alloy bodywork, maintaining the rugged utility capability while offering improved ride quality and axle articulation. Engine options evolved from the Series III petrol and diesel engines to include a 2.5-litre turbo diesel (1984), enlarged 2.5-litre petrol engines (1985), and the V8 petrol engine in the Ninety for the first time. Production of these models continued until 1990 when they were renamed Defender 90, Defender 110, and Defender 130 respectively."

  - name: "First Generation Defender (L315)"
    start_year: 1990
    end_year: 2006
    description: "In 1990, following the introduction of the Discovery, Land Rover renamed the Ninety and One Ten as Defender 90 and Defender 110, with the One Two Seven becoming Defender 130. The Defender name distinguished these utilitarian models from the more comfort-oriented Discovery within the Land Rover family. Designated as L315 from model year 1987 to 2006, this generation maintained the fundamental architecture of its predecessors while evolving continuously. The 200Tdi engine was introduced in 1990, featuring an alloy cylinder head, improved turbocharging, intercooling and direct injection, producing 111bhp and significantly improving high-speed cruising capability. This was followed by the 300Tdi in 1994, a virtually new engine despite the same capacity. In 1998, Land Rover introduced the Td5, an all-new 2.5-litre five-cylinder turbodiesel with electronic control systems producing 122bhp and improved refinement, though traditionalists criticized the increased electronic systems. The Defender retained its utilitarian design philosophy with removable doors and roof panels, fold-down windscreen, exposed door hinges, and robust mechanicals designed for field serviceability. The lineup included Defender 90 (short wheelbase), Defender 110 (long wheelbase), and Defender 130 (crew cab pickup). Special editions included the 90SV (1992), Limited Edition (1997), 50th Anniversary (1998), Heritage (1998), and Tomb Raider (2000)."

  - name: "First Generation Defender (L316)"
    start_year: 2007
    end_year: 2016
    description: "From spring 2007, the Defender was designated L316 and received major updates to meet emissions and safety legislation. The Td5 engine was replaced by a Ford DuraTorq 2.4-litre four-cylinder diesel engine (later 2.2-litre) from the Ford Transit, producing the same power but with improved torque from a variable-geometry turbocharger. A new six-speed gearbox replaced the previous transmission. The interior was completely redesigned with a full-width fascia, instruments from the Discovery 3, and improved heating and ventilation systems. Many heritage parts dating back to the 1970s were finally replaced, though some like the Metro-sourced steering column switches and Morris Marina ignition switch were carried over. European Union legislation required the removal of inward-facing rear seats, reducing capacity from six/seven to four/five in the 90 and from nine to seven in the 110. A new bodystyle 'utility' was introduced on the 110 chassis with windowless rear panels. External changes were minimal: a reshaped bonnet for the taller engine and removal of the distinctive external air vent flaps. Minor updates in 2012 introduced the 2.2-litre engine to meet Euro V standards with a diesel particulate filter. The last Defender rolled off the Solihull production line on 29 January 2016, with the number plate H166 HUE referencing the first pre-production Land Rover. A special Defender Works V8 edition was announced in January 2018 with a 5.0-litre Jaguar V8 engine producing 405hp."

  - name: "Second Generation (L663)"
    start_year: 2020
    end_year: null
    description: "The all-new Land Rover Defender launched in 2020 represented a complete reimagining of the iconic nameplate, built on JLR's Premium Transverse Architecture (PTA) platform. This generation switched from body-on-chassis construction to an aluminum monocoque body and from live rigid axles to all-independent suspension, while maintaining the distinctive boxy silhouette and utilitarian design cues of its predecessor. The L663 Defender was unveiled on 10 September 2019 at the Frankfurt Motor Show and is engineered to comply with global car regulations, sold in 128 territories including China and the United States. Initially available in '90' three-door and '110' five-door configurations, an eight-seater version of the 110 named the '130' was introduced in 2022. The powertrain range includes mild-hybrid inline-four and inline-six engines: the P300 (2.0L turbo four-cylinder producing 296hp), P400 (3.0L turbo inline-six producing 355hp), and the range-topping P525 supercharged 5.0L V8 in the Defender V8 variant producing 518hp. All variants feature permanent all-wheel drive through an eight-speed automatic transmission and two-speed transfer case. The advanced Terrain Response 2 system offers multiple driving modes optimized for different surfaces and conditions. Modern features include configurable digital displays, smartphone integration, over-the-air updates, and advanced driver assistance systems, while maintaining practical elements like removable roof panels, fold-flat rear seating, and substantial towing capacity up to 3,720 kg (8,201 pounds)."
