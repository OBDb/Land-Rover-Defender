  - name: "Land Rover 90/110 (Pre-Defender)"
    start_year: 1983
    end_year: 1990
    description: "The direct predecessor to the Defender name, the Land Rover 90 and 110 models were introduced in 1983 and 1984 respectively, replacing the aging Series III. These models marked a significant departure from the Series lineage with the introduction of coil spring suspension (replacing leaf springs), more modern styling, and improved comfort while maintaining the rugged utility that defined Land Rover. The numbers 90 and 110 referred to their wheelbase lengths in inches. The 110 was launched first in 1983, followed by the 90 in 1984. Both featured a separate steel chassis with aluminum body panels, permanent four-wheel drive with a two-speed transfer case, and were available in various body configurations including pickup, station wagon, and hard-top variants. Engine options included 2.5-liter petrol and diesel units, with the introduction of the more powerful 107bhp 2.5-liter 200Tdi turbodiesel engine. These models established the foundation for what would become the Defender, offering improved on-road manners without compromising off-road capability."

  - name: "First Generation Defender"
    start_year: 1990
    end_year: 2016
    description: "In 1990, following the introduction of the Discovery, Land Rover renamed the 90 and 110 models as Defender 90 and Defender 110, with the 130 variant joining the lineup. The Defender name distinguished these utilitarian models from the more comfort-oriented Discovery within the expanding Land Rover family. Built on the same fundamental architecture as its 90/110 predecessors, the first-generation Defender evolved continuously over its 26-year production run. The lineup included three wheelbase variants: Defender 90 (short wheelbase), Defender 110 (long wheelbase), and Defender 130 (crew cab pickup with extended rear overhang). Engine evolution included the 200Tdi (1990-1994), followed by the more refined 111bhp 300Tdi (1994-1998), and later the 2.5-liter Td5 turbodiesel (1998-2006) and finally the 2.2-liter and 2.4-liter Puma diesel engines in the final years. The Defender maintained its utilitarian design philosophy with removable doors and roof panels, fold-down windscreen, exposed door hinges, and simple robust mechanicals designed for field serviceability. Millennium updates in 2001 brought zinc-plated steel doors, electric windows, and central locking options while preserving the vehicle's fundamental character. Despite its agricultural origins, the Defender developed an increasingly diverse customer base spanning military, commercial, and luxury markets worldwide. Production concluded in January 2016 after nearly seven decades of continuous evolution from the original 1948 Land Rover."

  - name: "Second Generation (L663)"
    start_year: 2020
    end_year: null
    description: "The all-new Land Rover Defender launched in 2020 represented a complete reimagining of the iconic nameplate, built on JLR's Premium Transverse Architecture (PTA) platform shared with the Range Rover Evoque and Discovery Sport. While maintaining the distinctive boxy silhouette and utilitarian design cues of its predecessor, the L663 Defender incorporated modern technology, improved on-road manners, and enhanced comfort without compromising its legendary off-road capability. Initially available in 110 (long wheelbase, 5+2 seating) and 90 (short wheelbase, 5-seat) configurations, the lineup expanded to include the 130 variant in 2022, offering three rows of seating in a stretched platform. The powertrain range includes mild-hybrid inline-four and inline-six engines, with the P300 (2.0L turbo four-cylinder), P400 (3.0L turbo inline-six), and range-topping P525 (supercharged 5.0L V8 in the Defender V8 variant) producing between 296 and 518 horsepower. All variants feature permanent all-wheel drive through an eight-speed automatic transmission and two-speed transfer case. The advanced Terrain Response 2 system offers multiple driving modes optimized for different surfaces and conditions. Modern features include configurable digital displays, smartphone integration, over-the-air updates, and advanced driver assistance systems, while maintaining practical elements like removable roof panels, fold-flat rear seating, and substantial towing capacity up to 8,201 pounds. The new Defender has been praised for successfully bridging the gap between the original's uncompromising capability and modern expectations for refinement, comfort, and technology, while offering improved safety ratings and environmental compliance that the original could not achieve in contemporary markets."
